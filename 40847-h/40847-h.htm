</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">E</span>VERY Englishman, we imagine, knows that the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was the ship which bore Lord Nelson&rsquo;s
flag, and on board of which he received his death wound in
the moment of triumph over the combined fleets of France
and Spain, off Cape Trafalgar; but as very few are aware of
her numerous and distinguished services, extending over
many years, and preceding that sad yet glorious climax, this
memoir of her career has been drawn up, with the hope of
making her history from her launch to the present time
better known; and that the hundreds who yearly visit her
may carry away a record of their visit, to remind them of
the classic ground they have been treading, and recall to
their recollections some of the splendid deeds of the past,
which gained for England the proud title of &ldquo;Mistress of
the Seas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There have been &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory&rsquo;s</span>&rdquo; in the English navy ever
since the year 1570, and as each successive ship, from old
age or misfortune, has disappeared from the list, another has
soon after appeared to take her place.</p>

<p>The ship immediately preceding the existing &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo;
was, like her, a first-rate three-decker, carrying 110 guns,
and was accounted the finest ship in the service. In 1744
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
she was the flagship of Admiral Sir J. Balchen, a venerable
officer of 75 years of age, who had been called from the
honourable retirement of Greenwich Hospital to command a
fleet destined to relieve Sir Charles Hardy, then blockaded
in Lisbon by a superior French force, under the Count de
Rochambault. On returning from the successful performance
of this service, the fleet was dispersed in the chops
of the Channel by a tremendous gale, on October 4th. The
rest of the ships, though much shattered, gained the
anchorage of Spithead in safety, but the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was
never more heard of, though from the evidence of fishermen
of the island of Alderney, she was believed to have run on
to the Caskets, some dangerous rocks lying off that island,
where her gallant crew of about a thousand perished to a
man.</p>

<p>In 1765, on the 7th May, was launched from Chatham
Dockyard the present &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; which had been built
from designs of Sir Thomas Slade, then surveyor of the
navy.</p>

<p>Her principal dimensions are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1793 she had four 32-pr. carronades substituted on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
upper deck, and six 18-pr. carronades added on the poop,
making her total number of guns at this time 110. The six
last were subsequently removed, as at Trafalgar she had no
guns on the poop. In 1803, two 68-pr. carronades were
placed on the forecastle, instead of two 32-pr., when the
weight of her broadside fired from 52 guns was 1160 pounds.
It may here be mentioned, for the sake of comparison, that
the weight of the broadside of the <i>Monarch</i>, a modern ironclad,
carrying but six guns,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> is 2515 lbs., or more than
twice that of the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
Not including one that only fires aft.</p>
</div>

<p>As it happened, in 1765 England was at peace with all
the world, so the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; lay quietly at her moorings at
Chatham for 13 years, but in 1778, when war with France
became imminent, she was commissioned by Captain Sir J.
Lindsey on 15th March, and on Admiral Hon. Augustus
Keppel being appointed to the command of the Channel
Fleet he selected her as his flagship, and she was sent round
to Portsmouth, where, on May 16th, she hoisted his flag.
On the 7th June Keppel sailed from St. Helen&rsquo;s, with 21 sail
of the line, 3 frigates, and 3 sloops, having Sir Robert
Harland and Sir Hugh Palliser as his Vice-Admirals. His
position was a peculiar and delicate one, as war was not yet
declared, though all chance of peace being maintained was
at an end, but it was known that large and rich fleets of
merchantmen from our East and West Indian possessions
were on their way home, and it was unadvisable to allow
any French frigates to cruise at large and carry intelligence
of their whereabouts to Brest; besides this, Admiral Byron
with a small squadron was on the point of sailing to reinforce
our fleet on the American coast, and Keppel was
expected to cover his path. Under these circumstances,
when two French frigates hove in sight on the 17th June,
Keppel determined to detain them; one, the <i>Licorne</i>, submitted
after firing one broadside, but the other, the <i>Belle-Poule</i>,
attempted to escape, was pursued, and after a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
chase, brought to action by the <i>Arethusa</i>, Captain Marshall.
The two frigates were nearly equal in force, and after one of
the most desperate contests on record, the fight terminated
by the <i>Belle-Poule</i> drifting amongst the rocks of her own
coast, leaving the <i>Arethusa</i> a dismantled hulk, to be found
by the <i>Valiant</i>, and towed home. This action is perpetuated
in the well-known sea song, the &ldquo;Saucy Arethusa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the <i>Licorne</i>, Keppel learnt the unexpected and
unpleasant intelligence that the French fleet in Brest
amounted to 32 sail of the line and 12 frigates; as his own
only numbered 21, prudence dictated a return for reinforcement,
and he very unwillingly turned his back on France,
anchoring at St. Helen&rsquo;s on the 27th of June, and detaining
another French frigate, the <i>Pallas</i>, on his way.</p>

<p>On the 10th of July, war being now declared, he again
sailed, with 25 sail of the line, and was joined off Plymouth
by 5 more, making his total force 30 of the line and 4
frigates; with these he now proceeded in search of the
French Admiral D&rsquo;Orvilliers, who, with 32 ships of the line
and many frigates, had left Brest a few days before, hearing
that the expected British merchant fleets were at hand. The
object of the French was, of course, the capture of these
rich prizes, and they naturally wished to avoid a meeting
with the British men-of-war before this was accomplished.
On the other hand, the English longed for the battle, as the
shortest and safest mode of saving their convoys. So when
the two fleets sighted one another on the 23rd, the French,
being to windward, did their best to avoid an engagement,
and held their wind; on which Keppel finding he had no
chance of overtaking them if he kept his line of battle,
hoisted the signal for a general chase, and kept it flying.</p>

<p>Thus for four days were both fleets working to windward,
during which, two French line of battle ships were cut off,
but from their superior sailing escaped capture. Keppel
hoped that D&rsquo;Orvilliers would bear up to their rescue,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
but the wily Frenchman knew that if he did, he would
have to give up all hopes of his prize, and preferred that
his stray vessels should trust to their heels, which as we
have seen, bore them in good stead on this occasion. However,
this made the two fleets numerically equal, and, on the
forenoon of July 27th, being then some 100 miles west of
Ushant, the joy in the British fleet was excessive, when they
found that a shift of wind brought them into such a position
that an engagement was inevitable. The French still tried
to evade the fight, and put about on the other tack, bringing
the heads of the two lines pointed in nearly opposite directions,
and in this way the British van, commanded by Sir R.
Harland, came in action with the French centre, and
standing on until close to their line, ran along it to leeward.
The rest of the fleet followed, taking their positions in the
line as quickly as they could, the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; being in about
the centre.</p>

<p>It will be seen by this, that the fleets, after once meeting,
were parting each moment, and at the end of about two
hours, their respective rears were clear of one another.
Keppel then did his best to renew the battle, but from the
French practice of aiming at the spars, his ships were so
crippled that the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; and some four others, were
alone able to wear after the enemy. Under these circumstances,
and hoping to bring the enemy to action again next
day, as they also were much scattered and disabled, the
English Admiral got his ships together and repaired
damages. Unfortunately, the wind came fair for Brest in
the night, and the French, having succeeded in concealing
their movements, by stationing their frigates to show misleading
lights, ran for, and gained that port. Their mast
heads only were visible in the morning, and Keppel, after
chasing for two hours, found it hopeless and gave up the
pursuit.</p>

<p>Thus, for want of the man&oelig;uvre of &ldquo;breaking the line,&rdquo;
which Rodney, under precisely similar circumstances, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
successfully practised four years later, this engagement had
no results beyond that of saving the convoys, one of which
passed the scene of action the very next day. The
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; had, at one time, six enemy&rsquo;s ships on her, and
was much cut up in hull and rigging; her loss was 11 killed
and 24 wounded, being the largest number rendered <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de
combat</i> in any one ship of the British fleet, save one, the
<i>Formidable</i>. The total loss was 113 killed and 373
wounded. The French loss was never correctly ascertained,
but, as it was the English custom to fire at the hulls, it was
probably much more severe. Keppel returned to port, and
after refitting, again sailed from Plymouth on the 23rd
August, but never again met the enemy, and eventually
arrived at Portsmouth on the 28th of October.</p>

<p>This is the history of a ship, and not of the times, so we
have strictly nothing to do with subsequent events that
arose out of this engagement; but, as they created great
excitement, perhaps a short account of the sequel may not
be altogether out of place. At this period of our history,
the British public expected some tangible proofs of our
naval superiority whenever our fleets met an equal enemy, in
the shape of ships captured or destroyed; and the indecisive
results of the action of the 27th July, gave rise to a
multitude of paragraphs in the newspapers, commenting on
the conduct of the different Admirals, especially that of the
Commander-in-Chief, and Sir Hugh Palliser, and attributing
blame to one or the other, as their fancy, or rather their
politics dictated: the principals themselves (who were both
members of the House of Commons, but of opposite
parties), in exculpating themselves, became involved in
mutual recriminations, and finally Sir Hugh Palliser preferred
charges against Admiral Keppel, for, in a few words
not doing his best to &ldquo;burn, sink, and destroy.&rdquo; Suffice it
to say, that a Court Martial to try Admiral Keppel met at
Portsmouth on January 7th, 1779, and sat at the Governor&rsquo;s
house, by special Act of Parliament, on account of the bad
health of the accused, until February 11th, when it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
honourably acquitted him, and declared the charges
&ldquo;malicious and ill-founded.&rdquo; Keppel, by his former
victories and frank condescending manners, had long
rendered himself the idol of the navy and people, and the
first disappointment felt at the meagre results of his engagement
had been succeeded by a strong popular reaction
in his favour, when it was understood that he would be
placed on his trial. The news of his acquittal was received
throughout the country with an extraordinary burst of joy.
On the sentence being made known, a signal gun was fired
at Portsmouth, upon which the ships at Spithead immediately
cheered and saluted, and a fleet of Indiamen, lying
at the Mother Bank, fired 19 vollies. Nor were they behind
hand on shore in manifesting their delight; the bells of
Portsmouth church rang for the day, the late prisoner was
escorted from the court by a vast crowd, attended by some
of the most illustrious in the land; and such was his popularity,
that not only Portsmouth, but other towns were
illuminated, and the inhabitants rejoiced in the most frantic
way, as if for a great national deliverance.</p>

<p>Admiral Keppel was requested to retain the command of
the fleet, but refused, and was succeeded by Sir Charles
Hardy, who hoisted his flag in the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; on the 19th
March, 1779. Sir Charles found himself with 37 ships of
the line, which seems a large force, but the accounts of the
day state that a number of them were very badly manned;
however that may be, after sailing on June 16th, he was
cruising off Ushant on August 20th, when intelligence
reached him that the French and Spanish fleets had effected
a junction at Cadiz, and were then off Plymouth; he learnt
also that they consisted of 67 sail of the line, besides more
than 30 frigates, and smaller vessels. Sir Charles made sail
after them, and sighted them on 1st September, off Scilly,
when finding that his information as to their force was
correct, and reflecting that the safety of the country would
in a great measure depend on him should the enemy attempt
a landing, he retired to Spithead. This is, we believe, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
only time that the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was ever forced to show her
stern to an enemy.</p>

<p>The combined fleets, after making a great show, and
indulging in a parade off Plymouth, quitted the Channel
without attempting any enterprise. The British Admiral
cruised till the end of the year, when the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo;
returned to Portsmouth with her division, and, being placed
in dock, was coppered for the first time. In the spring,
whilst preparing to take the sea again, Sir C. Hardy was
seized with an apoplectic fit, and died on 14th May, 1780.</p>

<p>Admiral Geary then hoisted his flag in the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo;
on 24th May, on succeeding to the command of the Channel
fleet, and sailed early in June, with 29 line-of-battle ships, 14
of them three-deckers. He stationed himself off Brest,
which he watched for three months, his object being to
prevent the French from getting out, and joining the
Spaniards fitting in Cadiz; when, having over 2500 sick on
board his fleet, he returned to Spithead on the 18th August.
He captured a valuable convoy of merchantmen during his
cruise, but did not have a chance of measuring his strength
with the enemy. Feeling his health failing, Admiral Geary
resigned his command, and the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; struck his flag
on the 28th August.</p>

<p>Vice-Admiral Darby, who was on board the <i>Britannia</i>,
then took command of the Channel fleet, and the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; flew the flag of Rear-Admiral Drake, the 3rd in
seniority, but only for one cruise, as being afflicted with
severe attacks of gout, this officer resigned his post on 29th
December.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was next destined to be the flagship of
a squadron fitting for service in the North Sea, under Vice-Admiral
Hyde Parker, who hoisted his flag in her on March
20th, 1781, at Portsmouth. On May 20th, she sailed for
the Downs, with five other ships; but a few days after her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
arrival at that anchorage, Admiral Parker shifted his flag to
the <i>Fortitude</i>, a 74, as being better adapted for cruising in
the narrow seas to which he was bound, and the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo;
returning to Spithead, hoisted the broad pendant of
Commodore Elliott, and bore it for one cruise with the
fleet, in which nothing of importance took place.</p>

<p>In September of the same year, Rear-Admiral Kempenfelt,
hoisted his flag as fourth Admiral of Channel fleet and
cruised with it for two months; but in December he was
detached in command of a squadron of 12 sail of the line
and 5 frigates, to attempt to intercept M. de Guichen, who
had sailed from Brest, with a convoy, carrying troops and
laden with warlike stores intended for the Count de Grasse
in the West Indies.</p>

<p>Early on the 12th December, when 40 leagues west of
Ushant, the look out frigate, <i>Tisiphone</i>, Captain James
Saumarez, made the signal for an enemy&rsquo;s fleet, and boldly
crowded all sail to close them. In a short time, when the
day was fully broke, Kempenfelt found to his disgust, that
the enemy was much stronger than he had been led to
expect, as he could count 19 line of battle ships amongst the
crowd of ships to leeward of him; he therefore decided to
watch his opportunity before attacking; and, after sailing
along with, and to windward of the French fleet for a few
hours, his patience was rewarded by perceiving that the van
and centre, with most of the men-of-war, were separated by
a slight gap from the rear. He at once made a dash for the
opening, and, while with the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; and some others,
he engaged the rear of the French centre, and prevented
their returning to the rescue, his other vessels passed to
leeward and captured the whole of that division of the
convoy&mdash;15 ships&mdash;sinking four frigates that rashly, but
most gallantly, endeavoured to protect them.</p>

<p>As the wind was now fair for England, he formed his fleet
round the prizes, and keeping up a running fire, carried the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
whole of the captured ships into Plymouth in the face of the
enemy, and despite their utmost endeavours to prevent him.</p>

<p>Kempenfelt then returned to Spithead with his squadron,
of which he retained command till the month of March next
year, when he struck his flag in the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; and hoisted
it on board the <i>Royal George</i>. In this ship he was unhappily
drowned on the 29th August, on her capsizing at Spithead,
when over 900 persons perished in a few minutes. The
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was a witness of the melancholy catastrophe, and
her boats saved many of the survivors.</p>

<p>Lord Howe next hoisted his flag in the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; on
assuming command of the Channel Fleet, and cruised in the
course of the summer of 1782, but without any meetings with
the enemy or incidents worth recording.</p>

<p>At this time, the attention of England, and indeed her
enemies, was almost entirely fixed on the defence of Gibraltar
by General Elliot, and the probable fate of that fortress,
which though it had been besieged by both sea and land for
more than three years, had never been so hardly pressed as
now. Admiral Darby with a powerful fleet had relieved the
garrison from the greatest possible distress the year before,
but the supplies he then landed were now nearly exhausted,
the garrison were again commencing to feel the pangs of
hunger, and it was well known that the Spaniards had been
for months making preparations for an attack of a new kind,
and on a grand scale, which they trusted would compel the
proud stronghold to lower its colours. The new feature in
the attack was the construction of ten large floating batteries,
so covered and protected as to be considered practically
invulnerable; these were armed with 154 pieces of the
heaviest ordnance, and backed up as they were by 48
French and Spanish sail of the line, and 40,000 troops, the
expected assault was enough to make England tremble for
the result. It was accordingly resolved to make a great
effort to relieve Gibraltar, and in such a manner that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
should be not only a temporary but a permanent relief and to
this end a fleet of 36 sail of the line was got together, which
was to convoy a large number of merchantmen, laden with
every description of supplies, and carrying troops to reinforce
the garrison.</p>

<p>This fleet sailed on September 11th, with Lord Howe in
the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; as Commander-in-Chief, and as Juniors,
Vice-Admirals Barrington and Millbank; and Rear-Admirals
Alexander Hood and Hughes.</p>

<p>Before this succour could arrive, the grand attack on
Gibraltar had taken place. On September 9th the enemy&rsquo;s
batteries, after a temporary silence while preparing for the
struggle, re-opened, and continued a rain of shot and shell,
with scarcely any intermission, to the 13th, when the fleet
and floating batteries being brought into their assigned
positions, joined in the bombardment.</p>

<p>It is not our province to relate the details of that
memorable day&mdash;enough to state that the arrangements
which General Elliot&rsquo;s energy had made were equal to the
occasion; the invulnerable floating batteries were set on fire,
the fleet repulsed, the land attack took no effect, and the
baffled enemy, with enormous losses, withdrew from active
attack, to wait the results of the famine with which they
well knew the besieged were threatened, and which they
hoped would effect the capitulation their arms had failed to
force.</p>

<p>But Howe was approaching, not rapidly, for foul winds
detained him, but surely, and the combined fleets lying off
Algeciras were on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</i> to prevent his landing any
supplies, when on October 10th, a terrific gale assailed them,
which dismasted one, and drove five of their number from
their anchors; two of these got away into the Mediterranean,
but the other three went on shore in the bay, one of them
under our forts, where the crew were made prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
The very next day, while the enemy was thus thrown
into disorder, the British fleet made its appearance in the
Straits; and in the evening, four of the transports succeeded
in getting safe under the guns of Gibraltar, without any
attempt on the part of the combined fleets to hinder them,
much to the astonishment of Howe, who on learning some
days before of the failure of the grand attack, had also learnt
the avowed intention of the enemy to give him battle, and
had called all the Admirals on board the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; and
made known to them his determination to force his way
through at all hazards. The rest of the convoy from light
winds and bad management were swept past the Rock by
the current, and lost this favourable opportunity of accomplishing
their errand, a most fatal mischance, as ships once
driven to the eastward of Gibraltar, are sometimes weeks
before they can gain their anchorage on the western side.
The men-of-war followed, and spent next day in endeavouring
to work up with the transport against the strong easterly
current, in hopes of getting them in, before the enemy,
whose misfortunes they had now heard of were enabled to
interfere; but on the morning of the 13th the combined
fleets, having completed their refitting, weighed, and sailed
out of the bay, apparently intending to engage the English
ships, which were then but a few miles to the eastward of
Europa point, and in full sight of the garrison. Although
the gale of the 10th had reduced the enemy&rsquo;s force by six,
yet they still far out-numbered Howe&rsquo;s, as they mustered 80
sail of men-of-war, forty-four of which were of the line, while
Howe had but thirty-six with which to protect his charge;
nevertheless, he waited the advance with impatience and
confidence, having sent the merchant ships to the Zaffarin
Islands, as a rendezvous, until they should hear of the result
of the battle. But the enemy suddenly altered his course
and running past the British ships, disappeared in the dusk
of evening. Next day, neither of the fleets were to be seen
from the Rock, but some of the transports that had slipped
back, arrived, filling the garrison with joy. Thus several
days passed, when on the 18th, the remainder of the convoy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
who had heard of no engagement and ventured to leave
their retreat at Zaffarin, arrived in safety, completing the
primary object of their mission. Next morning both fleets
were again in sight from Gibraltar, with an easterly wind, the
British nearest. Howe had been following the enemy, who
was searching in vain for the missing convoy; but now,
hearing that his charge were all safely at anchor, and not
wishing to fight in the narrow space of the Straits, the
British Admiral, after landing a further supply of powder,
collected from his ships as he passed, under sail for the open
sea, and having gained it, awaited a second time the enemy&rsquo;s
attack.</p>

<p>The combined fleet, which had been reinforced by the
junction of the two ships that had been driven from Algeciras
were thus to windward, and had the entire option of time
and distance in their hands; they chose to advance very
leisurely, and to keep at a great distance, firing apparently at
the spars of the British ships, and never giving them the
opportunity of getting into close action. After continuing
this distant cannonade for some hours, the enemy again
hauled off, having inflicted a loss of 68 killed, and 280
wounded on the English. The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; herself did not
lose a man, or fire a single shot, and the other ships only
returned the fire very occasionally. Howe was much blamed
for not making greater exertions to engage the enemy, but it
is easier to talk of getting a fleet to windward than to do it,
and he does not seem to have had it in his power to do more
than he did. The morning after this skirmish, the enemy
being nowhere to be seen, Howe, according to orders, broke
up his fleet in detachments to reinforce various stations, and
returned home himself in the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; to Portsmouth,
which he reached on November 10th. Preliminaries of
peace were already at this time being discussed, and were
signed on 20th January following, and &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was
paid off at Portsmouth on February 27th, after a commission
of nearly five years, during which she had established the
character of being the best sailing three-decker ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
launched. This character she ever after maintained, and it
led to her being almost invariably chosen as flagship, by
every officer who had the chance of so doing.</p>

<p>On preparations being made in June 1790, in expectation
of war with Spain, the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was again commissioned.
Lord Howe at first had his flag in her, but when the
<i>Queen Charlotte</i> was ready, he went to that ship, and Lord
Hood succeeded him in the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>.&rdquo; She remained at
the North ready for service throughout that year, and part of
the next, when Hood was appointed to command the
Northern Fleet, fitting out in case our friendly relations with
Russia, then trembling in the balance, could not be maintained;
but the difficulty passed away, and in the summer of
1791 she was paid off and returned into ordinary.</p>

<p>But in February, 1793, when the French Republic had
sealed its former acts of lawlessness by the execution of
the King, Louis XVI, and had further cut itself off from
civilization by declaring war against the world, or against
such parts of the world as it was not already fighting with,
that war which is known in our annals as the &ldquo;War with the
Republic,&rdquo; commenced in earnest.</p>

<p>England&rsquo;s fleets were at once brought forward, and the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was again manned as the flagship of Lord
Hood, who was now appointed Commander-in-Chief in the
Mediterranean. He hoisted his flag at Portsmouth on the
evening of the 6th of May, and his Lordship sailed on the
22nd of the same month, accompanied by 6 two-deckers
and 5 frigates, which composed the last detachment of the
fleet he was to command; 14 other line-of-battle ships and
some frigates having preceded him, under Vice-Admirals
Hotham and Cosby, and Rear-Admirals Goodall and Gell.</p>

<p>On the 24th a junction was effected with Admiral
Hotham&rsquo;s divisions, and after waiting off Scilly a fortnight
for the passing of a convoy, Hood bore away for Gibraltar
with 11 sail of the line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
The first object of importance in the Mediterranean was
the reduction of Toulon if possible. In that port, the
great Southern French Arsenal, were known to be upwards of
30 sail of the line, 17 of them ready for sea, under the
orders of Admiral Trogoff, but as that officer was a staunch
monarchist, he was not expected to do anything that would
further the cause of republicanism, and the existence of a
strong royalist party in the south of France, favoured the
supposition that instead of resisting the British, the
Toulonese would receive them with open arms, as their
only chance of protection from that republic they so
thoroughly hated and feared.</p>

<p>Such being the posture of affairs, Hood hurried out to his
station, watering his ships at Cadiz, (for Spain was now our
ally against the common enemy) and Gibraltar. From the
latter place the fleet sailed, on June 27th, and on the 7th
July fell in with a Spanish fleet of 24 sail whose Admiral sent
a message to Lord Hood, to say that he had 1900 men sick
and was going into Carthagena, and, said the Captain of the
frigate &ldquo;no wonder, for we have been 60 days at sea.&rdquo; This
speech did not raise their new allies in the estimation of the
British, who laughed at such a notion, and left the Spaniards
to follow to Toulon, which was sighted on the 19th July, and
a flag of truce was sent in to propose an exchange of
prisoners. To this the enemy would not accede, but they
were now acquainted with the presence of Lord Hood&rsquo;s
fleet off the port, and those causes of dissension we have
mentioned began to operate, with the most important final
results.</p>

<p>Lord Hood cruised for a fortnight in sight of Toulon,
then sailed for Nice to show himself there, and on his return
on 20th August, heard that proposals were being made in
Toulon to put themselves under his protection. On the
23rd, Commissioners came on board the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; from
Marseilles with full powers to treat for peace, offering a
conditional surrender of Toulon and all the shipping,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
declaring a monarchical government the leading object of
their negotiation, and praying for speedy help against the
armies of the convention that were at that moment
approaching.</p>

<p>Our space will not permit a full account of the proceedings
at this time, and we must satisfy ourselves by stating that
Toulon was taken possession of on the 27th August, without
a blow, despite the threatened opposition of Admiral St.
Julien, the second in command, who was thorough republican;
the Spanish fleet hove in sight the same day, and
Toulon was soon occupied by the combined forces, and
vigorous steps taken to keep possession of our &ldquo;extraordinary
acquisition,&rdquo; as Nelson in one of his letters calls it. But the
enemy were at hand, mustering stronger and stronger every
day, and by November, General Dugommier was besieging
the town with 40,000 men, while the defenders, who only
mustered 16,000, were of different nationalities and had to
man a line 15 miles in length. On December 16th a position
on the heights commanding Toulon was carried by the
besiegers, and a council of war, hastily summoned, determined
to evacuate the town, carry off as many ships as possible,
and burn the rest. The evacuation was carried out successfully,
the troops and seamen were all embarked, and 15,000
of the inhabitants took refuge from the rage of their countrymen
on board the fleets. But the rest of the programme
was not so completely performed; the Spaniards had charged
themselves with the destruction of the ships in the inner
harbour, but either by carelessness or treachery, they very
imperfectly performed their task. They did <em>not</em> fire the
ships of war but <em>did</em> set alight to the powder vessels which
it was arranged should be scuttled; these blew up, nearly
destroying Captain Sidney Smith, who was burning the ships
in the outer mole; he gallantly attempted to repair the
omission, but was repulsed by the fire of the republicans who
were already in the town, and had to retire, leaving the
work but half done. Of 58 ships in the port when Lord
Hood arrived, 14 were destroyed, 19 carried off, and 25 left
to the French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
In all these operations the men of the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; if not
the ship herself, bore an active part, as they were landed,
and helped to man the batteries with the other ship&rsquo;s companies,
and suffered great losses in the continual bombardment
to which they were exposed. On one occasion, indeed,
the ship was like to have become the heroine of an
adventure which might have ended her days, for, on October
23rd, in one of the disputes, which, as might be expected,
were not unfrequent between our quondam enemies the
Spaniards and ourselves, Don Juan de Langara, the Spanish
Admiral, placed three of his three-deckers round the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; as she lay in the outer road of Toulon, as a
&ldquo;gentle moral persuasion&rdquo; on behalf of his demands. As
the English fleet at that time was reduced by the absence of
detachments to 10 sails, and their crews were weakened by
the landing parties, the Spanish Admiral with his 17 sail,
could have destroyed our ships, had he dared to carry
matters so far; but Lord Hood was firm, and the Spanish
ships resumed their former positions without any further
demonstrations.</p>

<p>The British fleet now withdrew to Hy&egrave;res, where they lay
and revictualled; and on the 24th of January, 1794, thinking
that something might yet be done to assist the royalist faction
in Corsica, Lord Hood proceeded with a fleet of 60 sail,
including transports, for the Bay of Fiorenzo. While
on the passage, a furious gale arose which dispersed them,
and the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; amongst others, was nearly disabled,
losing her mainyard and many of her sails, and was at one
time in danger of being lost. The scattered fleet put into
Porto Ferrajo on the 29th. Detachments of ships were sent
from here, with the troops, to attack San Fiorenzo, the
principal port of Corsica; and on the 19th February,
after standing a bombardment of eleven days, this town
capitulated. By this time the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; herself had
arrived.</p>

<p>Lord Hood then tried to persuade General Dundas, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
commanded the troops, of the practicability of taking Bastia,
the capital of the island; but that officer differed, and not
only refused to take any part in the attempt, but would not
even lend a mortar or gun, or any stores for the service, so
that Hood had actually to send to Naples for these most
necessary articles for a siege; for, probably believing that
the energy of Nelson, then Captain of the <i>Agamemnon</i>, who
had borne a most prominent part in these previous undertakings,
was sufficient to carry anything through with success,
the Admiral determined to attempt it alone with his sailors,
and 1000 men of different regiments who were embarked in
the ship as marines. He cruised in the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; for some
days, before Bastia, and then returned to San Fiorenzo, leaving
everything to the direction of Nelson, who worked as he
always did, untiringly. On April 4th Hood again went round
and assisted with his men, etc., in raising the shore batteries;
and on the 11th, when all was ready, a boat from the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; went in to demand the capitulation of the town.
This was refused with scorn, by the brave Frenchman, St.
Michel, who replied, that he &ldquo;had red-hot shot for our ships,
and bayonets for our men;&rdquo; the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; on receiving
this reply, hoisted a red flag, the preconcerted signal, and
immediately the batteries opened. The town replied, and
for some weeks the siege went on with varying success.</p>

<p>During this period General D&rsquo;Aubant, who had succeeded
General Dundas, would ride over with his staff from San
Fiorenzo, a distance of only twelve miles, and watch the
operations, his own men remaining inactive the while, and
it was his extraordinary conduct that urged the seamen to
exertions of which they might otherwise have been incapable.
The fire of the besiegers grew hotter and hotter;
new batteries were erected, and guns mounted on heights
deemed insurmountable, and on 19th May, their efforts were
rewarded by a boat from the town coming on board the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; with a proposal of surrender.</p>

<p>The preliminaries were speedily arranged, and on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
22nd the town and two frigates were given up. &ldquo;When I
reflect on what we have achieved,&rdquo; says Nelson in a letter to
his wife, &ldquo;I am all astonishment. I always was of opinion,
have ever acted up to it, and never have had any reason to
repent it, that one Englishman was equal to three Frenchmen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Calvi, the other principal town in Corsica, was now looked
upon as a desirable acquisition, but before anything could
be done, Hood received intelligence that the French fleet
had left Toulon, and immediately sailed in pursuit. He met
Admiral Hotham&rsquo;s squadron next day, and with 13 sail of
the line, sighted the Frenchmen on June 10th. The enemy
were chased for two days, but before they could be overtaken
they escaped into Gourjean Bay, where it was found impossible
to attack them, and Lord Hood returned with the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; and three other ships to Martello Bay, leaving
Vice-Admiral Hotham, with the remainder, to watch the
French, which we may remark, he did for five months without
success.</p>

<p>Nelson had been sent back to Bastia with his ship, as
soon as the inferiority of the enemy&rsquo;s fleet had been ascertained,
and as General Stuart, who had arrived with a reinforcement,
and was now in command of the troops, was a
very different man to either of his successors, and as anxious
as Nelson himself to lose no time in attacking Calvi, the
<i>Agamemnon</i> and transports went at once from Bastia to a
small bay about 3 miles from Calvi, where they arrived on
June 19th, and proceeded to land. On the same day the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; and <i>Britannia</i> anchored in Martello Bay, and
after sending parties of men by land to join Stuart and
Nelson, they came round to Calvi on the 27th, with all the
munitions of war they could muster, and lay off and on
during the siege.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; landed 7 of her own lower deck guns for
the batteries, as well as some guns she had from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
<i>Commerce de Marseilles</i>, and sent a strong party of seamen
to assist, but was not able to get into action herself from the
strength of the sea defences of the town. The seamen from
<i>Agamemnon</i>, &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; and transports, guided and incited
by Nelson&rsquo;s indomitable energy, again performed prodigies
in the way of work; they once more dragged guns up to
positions considered by the troops unattainable, made the
batteries, and fought them, and gained the warm praise and
thanks of General Stuart, for the valuable assistance they
afforded.</p>

<p>The town surrendered on August 10th, after enduring a
siege of 51 days. In these operations, several officers and
men of the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; were killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Nelson himself was nearly slain, but got off with the loss
of an eye. His wound was never reported, and he only
casually mentioned that he had received a slight hurt which
laid him up one day. All this time, Lord Hood, on whose
health the anxious work at Toulon had told considerably,
remained on board the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; and sent supplies to the
shore parties when required. The ship was once blown
off by a gale, but resumed her position after an absence of a
week.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; next proceeded to Genoa, and in the first
week of November, she left for England, taking Lord Hood
with her, his health not being able to stand the fatigues of
the command any longer. She arrived at Portsmouth in
December, and Lord Hood went on leave, but rehoisted
his flag on the 14th April following, after the ship had had a
thorough refit.</p>

<p>On May 1st, 1795, the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was again a spectator
of the destruction of a sister first rate, the <i>Boyne</i> of 98 guns,
which caught fire and blew up at Spithead, where remnants
of her remain to this day off Southsea Castle, marked by a
green buoy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
On 2nd of May, as Lord Hood was on the point of
leaving to resume his command, he was ordered to strike his
flag, and &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; sailed out on 24th May, as a private
ship,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> with Rear-Admiral Man, who was taking a reinforcement
out to Admiral Hotham, then confirmed Commander-in-Chief
in the Mediterranean. Man joined Hotham&rsquo;s fleet
off Minorca on June 14th, and on 8th July, on the fleet
weighing from San Fiorenzo Bay, to pursue the enemy, he
shifted his flag to the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a>
&ldquo;A private ship&rdquo; is a man-of-war that does not have an
Admiral on board.</p>
</div>

<p>The French fleet of 17 sail, under Admiral Martin, were
sighted off Hy&egrave;res at daylight on July 13th, and the signal
for a general chase was thrown out by the <i>Britannia</i>,
Admiral Hotham&rsquo;s flagship.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was always celebrated for her good
sailing qualities, and on this occasion they shone out particularly
conspicuous, for, at half-past noon, she, with the
<i>Culloden</i> and <i>Cumberland</i>, came within range of the rearmost
of the enemy, while the rest of their companions were
astern at distances ranging from 1 to 9 miles, the Commander-in-Chief
being one of the farthest, for the <i>Britannia</i>
was as bad a sailer as the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was a good one. They
opened fire, but at this moment the wind unfortunately failed,
and they were unable to get into close action, though at the
end of an hour the <i>Alcide</i>, a seventy-four, struck. They still
hoped to make more prizes, but had by four o&rsquo;clock drifted
so near the shore, that the signal to discontinue the action
was made, and the French escaped through the shoals, the
passages between which they were familiar with, into Fr&eacute;jus
Bay.</p>

<p>The <i>Alcide</i>, which had made a most gallant defence, unluckily
took fire shortly after striking, and blew up with the
loss of all her crew, save 200. In the skirmish, the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was the greatest sufferer, having her rigging much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
cut, and all her lower masts badly wounded. She lost 5
killed (2 officers), and 16 wounded.</p>

<p>Man retained his flag in her until October, when he
shifted to the <i>Windsor Castle</i>, and was succeeded by Vice-Admiral
Robert Linzee, who flew his flag in the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo;
for a month only. During this period she was cruising with
a fleet, watching Toulon, and going from port to port in that
vicinity, until the 3rd of December, 1795, when being at
San Fiorenzo in Corsica, Sir John Jervis, who had arrived
from England a few days before, hoisted his flag in her as
Commander-in-Chief, and at once proceeded off Toulon.
He remained cruising between that port and Minorca, with
a fleet of about 13 sail, until the autumn of 1796, but up to
this time no incidents took place that are worth recording.</p>

<p>Spain had made a peace with France in 1794; and now
in August 1796, an alliance, offensive and defensive, was
concluded between the two powers. This put Sir John
Jervis in a very critical position, as the united French and
Spanish fleets amounted to 38 ships of the line, while Sir
John, who was at Martello Bay, had but 15. It
was determined accordingly, to evacuate Corsica, as the
power of the French republic, and the deeds of their
countryman, Buonaparte, were awaking feelings in the
inhabitants that were not amicable to England. This was
completed on the 2nd November, and Sir John and all his
fleet sailed from Corsica, and escorted the transports to
Gibraltar, which was reached on December 11th. On the
16th he went on to Lisbon to meet some expected reinforcements
from home.</p>

<p>Here he remained until the 18th January, when he sailed
with 10 ships only; but on February 6th 5 more joined from
England, when his force consisted of the following line-of-battle
ships, with which he cruised, awaiting news of the
enemy.</p>

<p>On the 13th, when off Cape St. Vincent, Commodore
Nelson in the <i>Minerve</i> frigate, joined, and reported having
been chased by the Spaniards. This was a fleet of 27 sail
of the line, which had passed the Straits on the 5th, and
was then working up for Cadiz, with the intention of picking
up more ships there, and then proceeding for Brest to join
the French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
The morning of the 14th, the &lsquo;glorious St. Valentine&rsquo;s
day,&rsquo; 1791, broke thick and misty, but as soon as daylight
made its appearance, the Spaniards were sighted to the S.W.;
one by one they were made out through the fog, and
reported to the Admiral, who received the report of their
increasing numbers with imperturbability, and when the
whole 27 sail were fully in sight, and Captain Calder
expressed some hesitation about the wisdom of coping
with such odds, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Enough Sir, were there
<em>fifty</em> I will go through them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Spanish fleet were much scattered and in no particular
order, but some eight ships were considerably to
leeward of the rest, leaving a distinct gap, which was, however,
rapidly narrowing, by the nineteen ships to windward
running down to join their companions. For this gap the
British ships pushed with all sail in a compact line,
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; in the centre. A few minutes hesitation
might have been fatal, for had the enemy got all his ships
together, the 15 English vessels would have fought against
great odds; but Jervis was a bold Commander, to whom
indecision was unknown, and who was well aware of the
value of the presence of a man like Nelson, and, indeed,
it was mainly by the latter&rsquo;s daring man&oelig;uvre at a later
period of the action, that the Spaniards were prevented
from effecting their junction.</p>

<p>As it was, they were just in time, and as soon as the
weather division of Spaniards saw the head of the English
line between them and their friends, they hauled to the
wind on the opposite tack, hoping to get round the rear of
the British line, and so effect their purpose. Their lee
division still stood determinedly on, and attempted to cut
the British line ahead of the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; herself, but she, by
her rapid advance, frustrated this, and forced the <i>Principe
de Asturias</i>, of 112 guns, to put about to avoid a collision.
The Spanish ship, which bore the flag of one of their Rear
Admirals, let fly her broadside as she shot up in the wind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
but either from the obscurity caused by smoke, or by mistaken
orders this was done at the wrong time, and extraordinary to
relate, not a shot struck the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>.&rdquo; With a ringing
cheer of derision from her crew, the British flagship re-paid
the compliment, but with interest, for as the Spanish three-decker
slowly turned round and presented her stern to her,
the whole of the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory&rsquo;s</span>&rdquo; guns were discharged into it
with destructive effect. The Spaniard ran straight away to
leeward, followed by his whole division, and until the close
of the day, never appeared again in the action.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the weather division, as has been said,
were intending to round the rear of our line, and so join
their ships to leeward, but Nelson, in the <i>Captain</i>, the third
ship of the line from the rear, saw their object the instant
their van bore up together astern, and immediately wearing
round, plunged fearlessly into their midst. He was followed
by the <i>Culloden</i> and <i>Excellent</i>, and the Spanish Admiral,
daunted by this spirited conduct, hauled to the wind, and
gave up the attempt.</p>

<p>The annexed plan may help to the comprehension of
the position of affairs at this period of the action.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;">

<p class="link"><a href="images/shv03.png">See larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>The other British ships in the meantime were tacking
in succession, and one after another came into action to the
support of their comrades.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; engaged the <i>Salvador del Mundo</i>, a
112 gun ship, which had already been mauled by the
<i>Excellent</i>, and forced her to strike her colours. This was at
3, p.m., and shortly afterwards, Sir John, who was discreet
as he was bold, observing that about 24 Spaniards (composed
of the 8 lee ships, and odd ships of the weather
division, who were all fresh) were bearing down on them,
made the signal to close up to cover the prizes; this was
immediately done, and the Spaniards, not liking the look of
the compact line of the British, hauled off, and made no
effort to continue the action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
In this battle, Nelson particularly distinguished himself,
as in his little 74, the <i>Captain</i>, he boarded in succession,
and took, the <i>San Nicholas</i>, of 80, and <i>San Josef</i>, of 112
guns; the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; passing just at that time, gave the
gallant <i>Captain</i> three cheers. Nelson went on board the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; after the action, and was warmly embraced by
Sir John Jervis, on the very quarter-deck on which he was
to fall, covered with glory, eight years later, and not far from
the place where this battle had been fought.</p>

<p>But for all these details we must refer the reader to
<i>James&rsquo;s</i>, <i>Drinkwater&rsquo;s</i>, and other accounts.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; strange to say, had but 1 man killed,
and 8 wounded; the total loss in the English fleet being
about 350 killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The fruits of the victory were the <i>San Josef</i>, <i>Salvador
del Mundo</i>, 112, <i>San Nicholas</i>, 80, and <i>San Isidro</i>, 74; a
result, that considering these prizes were wrested from 27
ships by 15, cannot but be considered as most glorious.</p>

<p>The enemy, next day, had it in their power to renew the
action with 21 ships. Who can say what the result might
have been, for some of our vessels were so disabled as to
render it necessary to tow them; but though the Spaniards
once made a feint, as if they would attack, they finally disappeared,
allowing our fleet and prizes to arrive safely at
Lagos Bay, in Portugal, where they anchored on the 16th.</p>

<p>On the 19th, they experienced a gale of wind that drove
the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; from her anchors, whereby she had a most
narrow escape of being wrecked. On the 23rd they sailed,
and arrived at Lisbon on the 28th, without accident or
molestation.</p>

<p>The news of the battle of Cape St. Vincent, as it was
called, was received in England with frantic joy; great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
rejoicings took place throughout the kingdom, the fleet
received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament, Sir John
Jervis was created Earl of St. Vincent, Admirals Thompson
and Parker were made Baronets, and the gallant Commodore
Nelson was invested with the honours of the Bath.</p>

<p>On the 28th March Sir John Jervis was reinforced by a
squadron from England, when he shifted his flag on the 30th
from the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; to the <i>Ville de Paris</i>, a new three-decked
ship.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed next day (the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; being now a
private ship) and proceeded off Cadiz, where Nelson had
been cruising for some time watching the Spanish ships,
who, ever since the 16th of February had lain in that port,
hooted and jeered at by the populace, and their Admirals
and Captains disgraced.</p>

<p>Jervis blockaded Cadiz during the summer, the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; serving in sometimes the outer, sometimes the
in-shore squadron, and sending her boats to take part in the
night attacks, undertaken by Commodore Nelson, with the
hopes of shaming the Spaniards to come out. On one of
these occasions, 5th July, some of her men were wounded.
But the Dons were not to be lured out, and on the approach
of winter, Earl St. Vincent withdrew his vessels to the
Tagus, and amongst other ships sent the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; home,
with the prizes taken on February 14th. She arrived at
Spithead on October 1st, and thence going to Chatham, paid
off on November 26th, after another long and eventful
commission of nearly five years duration.</p>

<p>Worn out, and unfit for further active service, the poor
old &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was here degraded to the office of prison
hospital ship, which she filled for two years, when, unwilling
that such a favourite and fast sailing ship should be lost to
the country, the Admiralty directed her to be thoroughly
repaired. This took a year, and in the spring of 1801 she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
came out of dock almost a new ship, but she was not ready
for service in the Baltic campaign of that date, and had rest
at Chatham for still two years.</p>

<p>The peace concluded between England and France in
1802 was not of long duration, for on April 29th, 1803, war
was again declared; this had been foreseen, and early in the
month, great preparations were made in all the dockyards.
Lord Nelson was appointed Commander-in-Chief in the
Mediterranean, and selected the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; as his flagship.
She was commissioned at Chatham, on April 9th,
and on 16th May arrived at Spithead. Nelson was waiting
for her, but could not get away for a few days; and such
was his impatience to sail, that in answer to everyone who
spoke to him on the 19th of his departure, he said, &ldquo;I
cannot sail till to-morrow, and that&rsquo;s an age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went on board on the 20th, and sailed in a violent
squall of wind and rain the same afternoon, having orders to
speak Admiral Cornwallis off Brest, and if necessary to leave
the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; with him, and go on a frigate. On the
22nd he was in sight of Brest, but no Cornwallis was to be
seen, and after chafing for a day, his anxiety did not permit
him to wait any longer, so striking his flag in the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo;
he went on board the <i>Amphion</i>, leaving the former ship to
find the Admiral of the Channel Fleet, and if not required,
to follow him with all speed.</p>

<p>Within forty hours after Lord Nelson left him, Captain
Sutton met Lord Cornwallis, and was immediately permitted
to resume his voyage. A few days after, the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo;
fell in with the <i>Ambuscade</i>, a French frigate, formerly an
English one, which she re-captured, and on the 12th June,
she anchored at Gibraltar. After watering, she left on the
15th, called at Malta on the 9th July, and on the 30th,
joined the squadron of 5 line-of-battle ships, off Cape
Sicie, when Lord Nelson at once shifted into her, bringing
Captain T. Masterman Hardy with him, from the <i>Amphion</i>,
Captain Sutton of the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; exchanging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
For 18 months subsequent to this, there is no fact worth
recording in the history of the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>.&rdquo; During that
time Lord Nelson, with a fleet that averaged 10 sail of the
line, closely watched the road of Toulon, where a French
fleet lay at anchor, going occasionally to Agincourt Sound, in
Sardinia, for water, &amp;c., but the French never showed any
sign of moving, until the beginning of 1805, though every
stratagem was tried to entice them to come out.</p>

<p>Spain had declared war with England on 12th December,
1804, and Buonaparte had formed a great plan for the
invasion of Britain, the first step to the accomplishment of
which, was to gain the command of the Channel. This
could only be done by placing an overwhelming force of
ships there, and by misleading the English as to his design.
With this object in view, Admiral Villeneuve, who was now
in command at Toulon, prepared for sea, and embarked on
board his 11 ships, 3,500 soldiers.</p>

<p>His orders, as subsequently ascertained were, to proceed
to the West Indies, effect a junction there with a fleet of 21
sail from Brest, land his troops, and if opportunity offered,
ravage our colonies; then return with speed to Ferrol,
where the Spaniards were to have a fleet of at least 25 sail
ready to join him, and with this overpowering force, he was
expected to keep our ships at bay, while the bold originator
of this scheme, Napoleon, crossed the Channel himself, at
the head of 170,000 men. We shall see how much easier
this was to plan than to carry out.</p>

<p>On January 12th, 1805, well nigh worn out with watching,
hoping, and fearing, his ships and their rigging rotten,
Nelson left his station off Toulon, for the anchorage at
Agincourt Sound, which he called his &ldquo;home,&rdquo; to water
and refit, leaving his two frigates to watch the enemy.</p>

<p>The fleet now consisted of the following ships:&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo;
104, <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, 100, <i>Canopus</i>, 80,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
<i>Spencer</i>, 74, <i>Leviathan</i>, 74, <i>Tigre</i>, 80, <i>Superb</i>, 74, <i>Belleisle</i>,
74, <i>Swiftsure</i>, 74, <i>Conqueror</i>, 74, <i>Donegal</i>, 74.</p>

<p>On the 17th Villeneuve put to sea, and on the 19th
January, at 2 p.m., the fleet in Agincourt Sound was electrified
by the appearance of the frigates, with the welcome
signal flying, &ldquo;enemy is at sea.&rdquo; In two hours the ships
were under weigh, and made sail for the passage between
Biche and Sardinia, a passage so narrow that the ships had
to proceed in single line, directed by the lights of their
next ahead, and led by the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; who took them
through in safety.</p>

<p>Nelson had nothing to guide him as to where the French
were bound, but he knew they could not be far off, and dispatched
the few frigates he had to scour the coasts in search,
but all to no purpose&mdash;no tidings could be obtained. A
gale that arose on the 21st, and that lasted a week, blew in
the teeth of the fleet as it attempted to go south, and Nelson
was wild at the thought that they had escaped him. The
only place his reasoning led him to suppose they could have
sailed for, was Egypt, and thither he turned his ships&rsquo; heads.
He arrived off Alexandria on 7th February, but found no
sign of them there either; immediately he retraced his steps,
and called off Malta, and here he learnt that the French
fleet were dispersed and disabled by the gale on the 21st,
and had returned to Toulon, scattered and crippled.</p>

<p>Nelson, in a letter to Admiral Collingwood, thus writes
on the subject. &ldquo;Buonaparte has often made his brags
that our fleet would be worn out by keeping the sea; that
his was kept in order and increasing by being kept in
port; but he now finds I fancy, <em>if Emperors hear truth</em>,
that his fleet suffers more in one night, than ours in a
year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By March 12th, the British fleet, after struggling with a
continuation of gales, succeeded in regaining their station off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
Toulon, and to their joy, saw the enemy still at anchor, and
after watching them till the 27th, they proceeded to Palma
Bay to get that refit they so much required, as during all this
cruise, every ship had been strained to her utmost.</p>

<p>Villeneuve took the first opportunity to escape again,
after his ships were repaired, and on 29th March ran out of
Toulon roads; on the 31st he was discovered off Cape
Sicie, by the <i>Ph&oelig;be</i>, which vessel lost no time in communicating
her intelligence to the Admiral, who was again on his
way to Toulon; and once more the exciting chase began.
The frigates, most unfortunately, lost the French ships, and
could give no intelligence of their apparent destination.
Again Nelson thought of Egypt, and proceeded off Sicily,
sending ships right and left to get information, and on the
15th April, when off Palermo, he first heard of the evident
intention of the enemy to go westward. At once he made
sail in pursuit, but the fates were against him, and while the
French in their passage down the Spanish coast had been
favoured with easterly winds, he could get nothing but
westerly gales. &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;this ill luck will go
near to kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the 4th May, before the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; and her
consorts anchored in Tetuan Bay to water and provision.
Sailing the next day, they put into Gibraltar for a few hours,
and learnt nothing there, but that the enemy&rsquo;s fleet had
passed the Straits on the 8th April, nearly a month in
advance of them. Nelson at once went to Cape St.
Vincent, hoping to get news, and the next day he received
the first reliable information from an American brig, which
was to the effect, that on the 9th April, the French fleet of
11 sail had appeared off Cadiz, been joined by a squadron
of five Spanish and 2 French line-of-battle ships, and
immediately resumed their voyage. He then heard from an
Admiral Campbell in the Portuguese service, that their
destination was the West Indies; this tallied with his own
ideas, and he instantly decided on following.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
On May 10th he put into Lagos Bay to get more
provisions, and on the 11th, having sent the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>
back to the Mediterranean, as a slow sailer who was likely
to hinder him, he started in pursuit of the 18 ships of the
enemy, with but 10 of his own. His anxiety at this time was
extreme; he was very ill, and had been told by his
physicians that he ought to go home, but &ldquo;salt beef and
the French fleet is far preferable to roast beef and
champagne without them;&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;my health or my
life even must not come into consideration at this
important crisis.&rdquo; Captain Hardy is reported to have said
to him, &ldquo;I suppose, my Lord, that by crowding all this sail
you mean to attack those 18 ships?&rdquo; &ldquo;By God, Hardy,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;that I do;&rdquo; and on the passage over, he took
every opportunity of making his plans known to his captains,
that a success might be ensured if possible. Barbadoes was
reached on June 4th, and here he received information that
led him to suppose that either Tobago or Trinidad was the
object of the combined fleet, who had been seen on the
28th May, and, embarking 2000 men, he hurried on for the
latter island. Off Tobago he received corroborative news
from an American schooner, who must have deceived him on
purpose and all was preparation in the English fleet.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 7th June, the ships stood
along the north shore of Trinidad; and had anything been
wanting to confirm the intelligence they had received, it was
supplied in the conflagration of a battery, that protected a
little cove in the steep coast, and the flight of its garrison,
who were seen speeding away in the direction of the town.
The remembrance of Aboukir Bay rose in their minds,
every man expected that the deeds of that glorious day
would be repeated in the Gulf of Paria, and as the ships
sailed, prepared for battle, through the Bocas of Trinidad,
expectation was strained to the utmost, to catch the first
glimpse of the enemy they fully relied on seeing on rounding
the point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
What was their astonishment then on coming in view of
the town, to find the Union Jack still waving over the forts,
and no French men-of-war to be seen.</p>

<p>Nelson at once anchored for the night without communication,
and early next morning sailed for Grenada.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the town of Puerto d&rsquo;Espana, the
capital of Trinidad, was the scene of the wildest excitement.
The lieutenant of artillery in command of the above-mentioned
out-post, finding a fleet close to him in the
morning, and making no doubt it was that of the enemy (for
no one knew of Nelson&rsquo;s arrival in the West Indies), had
burnt his barracks, thrown his guns over the cliff, and
hastened back to the town, spreading dismay with the intelligence
that the French were upon them. The inhabitants at
once fled to the interior, the troops were drawn into the
forts, and the town was left at the mercy of the French
Republicans, of whom there were many in the island, and
who now came forward and proclaimed themselves, believing
their friends were at hand.</p>

<p>The movements of the fleet were inexplicable to the
governor, and he was at once puzzled and relieved, when
daylight revealed the strange ships underweigh, and
leaving their shores. It was some days before the mystery
was explained, and they learnt that Nelson had paid them a
visit.</p>

<p>He, in the meanwhile, was hurrying along the chain of
islands to the north, getting information, true or false, every
day. On the 11th he heard that the enemy, now consisting
of 20 sail, had passed Antigua, steering northward; and at
once concluding that they were bound for Europe, he landed
the troops at Antigua on the 12th, and left next day for
Gibraltar, not without hopes of still catching them up.</p>

<p>This promptitude on the part of Nelson in following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
Villeneuve to the West Indies, doubtless saved some of our
possessions there, as there was no force to withstand the
combined fleets; but such was the terror of his name, that
no sooner did the enemy hear of his approach, although he
had but half their number of ships, than they immediately
started again on their return, without attempting to carry out
that part of their programme, which directed them to ravage
our colonies.</p>

<p>Nelson&rsquo;s squadron, after a most tedious voyage, arrived
at Gibraltar on July 20th, when he went on shore; this was
the first time for two years that he had put his foot out of
the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; for such had been his anxiety during
his long blockade of Toulon to be ready at any moment,
that it had never suffered him to leave his ship for an instant.
Nothing up to this time had been heard of the enemy, and
the indefatigable Nelson, after watering and provisioning at
Tetuan, sailed again on the 23rd July.</p>

<p>He spoke Admiral Collingwood&rsquo;s squadron on 26th, and
receiving information that the enemy had gone to the northward,
he proceeded for Ushant, off which, on August 15th,
he met Admiral Cornwallis with the Channel fleet of 24 sail
of the line, and from him received an order to leave eight of
the ships with him, and repair with &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; and <i>Superb</i>
to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>The two ships arrived at Spithead on the 18th, when
they were put in quarantine for a day, to Nelson&rsquo;s great
indignation; they were then released, and Nelson went to
his home at Merton, to get that rest he so badly needed.
The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; remained at Spithead, and did what
repairs she could at that anchorage during her brief stay.</p>

<p>A short account of the proceedings of the combined
fleets up to this time, may tend to the elucidation of
the state of affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
When Villeneuve made his escape from the Mediterranean,
the Brest squadron attempted to put to sea to join
him at Martinique, but the determined front put on by Lord
Gardner, who commanded the Channel fleet, then blockading
Brest, daunted the enemy, who put back again into
port. This was failure number one, in Buonaparte&rsquo;s scheme.</p>

<p>We have followed Villeneuve with his 20 sail of French
and Spanish line-of-battle ships to Antigua; thence he
proceeded for Brest, intending to effect a junction with the
fleet awaiting him there; but on July 22nd, Sir Robert
Calder, who was watching Ferrol and had been warned by a
frigate from Lord Nelson of the probable approach of the
enemy, met and engaged him, and though he numbered but
15 to 20, he took two ships of the line, and forced the
French admiral from his design. This was the second
breakdown in the programme; however, Villeneuve got
into Ferrol and joined the ships there, which made his
force 29 sail of the line, and with these he sailed on August
9th, but, for some unexplained cause, instead of now
making his way to Brest, he turned south and entered Cadiz
on the 21st, driving off Admiral Collingwood&rsquo;s small
squadron.</p>

<p>On September 2nd, Captain Blackwood, on his way to
London with the news of the combined fleets having left
Ferrol, called at 5 a.m. at Merton, where he found Lord
Nelson up and dressed; the latter immediately said, &ldquo;you
bring me news of the French and Spanish fleets, I shall have
to give them a drubbing yet;&rdquo; and going up to town with
him, offered his services to the Admiralty. These were
gladly accepted, and the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; again hoisted his flag
on September 15th, and sailed the same day in company
with the <i>Euryalus</i>, Captain Blackwood, which frigate he
afterwards despatched ahead to direct that the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo;
should not be saluted on her arrival, in order that the
enemy should be unaware of the reinforcement. On the
28th of the same month he joined, and took command of,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
the fleet off Cadiz, which, by the junction of Sir Robert
Calder&rsquo;s ships to Admiral Collingwood&rsquo;s now consisted of 29
sail.</p>

<p>On October 4th, Nelson dispatched Rear-Admiral Louis
with 5 sail of the line to Gibraltar, but a small squadron
from England joined a few days afterwards, making up his
fleet to the following 27 sail of the line.</p>

<p>Before continuing our narrative, we must again remind
our readers that this is but the history of one ship, and that
in our account of Trafalgar, only a sufficient general description
of the movements of the fleet will be given, to render
the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory&rsquo;s</span>&rdquo; part intelligible; for details, we must again
refer to <i>James&rsquo;s Naval History</i>, where the most complete
account of the action that has been published, will be
found.</p>

<p>On 19th October, the Franco-Spanish fleet, of 33 sail of
the line, under Admiral Villeneuve, as Commander-in-Chief,
and Admiral Gravina, (Spanish), as second, came out of
Cadiz, and, after some man&oelig;uvring, at daylight on the 21st,
the two fleets were in sight of one another, being then about
20 miles west of Cape Trafalgar. The wind was light, from
the W.N.W., and the enemy were in a straggling line on the
starboard tack, under easy sail; the British fleet were in two
columns on the port tack, and some ten miles dead to
windward. At 6.50, the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; made the signal to
bear up, on which the enemy wore together, thus presenting
his port broadside to the English fleet, which bore down
with a very light wind right aft, and with all studding sails
set; the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; leading the port line, and the <i>Royal
Sovereign</i> the starboard, the latter being somewhat in
advance.</p>

<p>Thus the British very slowly closed with the enemy, Lord
Nelson refusing to allow the <i>Temeraire</i>, his next astern, to take
the lead, and thereby bear the brunt of the battle. His
Lordship visited the decks of his ship, exhorted his men
not to throw away a shot, and was received with cheers as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
again went on deck. Having made every other signal to his
fleet he thought necessary, he finished with that most celebrated
one&mdash;&ldquo;England expects that every man will do his
duty,&rdquo;&mdash;which, at 11.40, was hoisted at the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory&rsquo;s</span>&rdquo;
mizen-topgallant-masthead, and was received by most of the
ships with cheers.</p>

<p>This made, Lord Nelson&rsquo;s customary signal on going
into action&mdash;&ldquo;Engage the enemy more closely&rdquo;&mdash;was hoisted
at the main, and there remained until the mast was shot
away.</p>

<p>At noon, the action commenced by the <i>Fougoeux</i> opening
fire on the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, on which the British Admirals
hoisted their flags, and all their ships the white ensign, having
also, each, two Union Jacks in the rigging. Twenty
minutes later the enemy&rsquo;s ships ahead of the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo;
began a furious cannonade on her, which killed in a short
time amongst many others, Mr. Scott, Lord Nelson&rsquo;s secretary.
Seeing Nelson&rsquo;s intention to break the line, the enemy closed
up ahead of him, making an almost impenetrable line; but
the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; still held her course, and steered straight
for the mass of ships grouped round the <i>Bucentaure</i>, a
French 80, on board of which was Villeneuve, the French
Commander-in-Chief, though he never showed his flag during
the action.</p>

<p>Nelson directed Captain Hardy to run on board any
ship he chose, as it was evident they could not pass through
the line without a collision, and at 12.30, not having as yet
fired a single shot, the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; passed slowly under the
stern of the <i>Bucentaure</i>, so close as almost to be able to
catch hold of her ensign, and discharge the port guns in
succession right into her cabin windows, placing about 400
men <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>, by that one broadside, and almost disabling
her from further resistance. The position of the ships
at this moment is shown in the accompanying plan.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">

<p class="link"><a href="images/shv04.png">See larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
At the same time the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; fired her starboard guns
at two vessels on that side of her, and five minutes later ran
on board the <i>Redoutable</i>, a French 74, hooking her boom
iron into the Frenchman&rsquo;s topsails, and so dropped alongside,
the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; being on the <i>Redoutable&rsquo;s</i> port side, and the
latter closing her lower deck ports to prevent boarding. A
tremendous cannonade ensued, the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; firing her
port guns at the <i>Bucentaure</i> and <i>Santissima Trinidada</i>, her
starboard ones being very fully employed by the <i>Redoutable</i>
which was so close alongside, that the men on the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory&rsquo;s</span>&rdquo; lower deck on each discharge dashed a bucket
of water into the hole made in the enemy&rsquo;s side by the shot,
to prevent the spread of the fire that might have destroyed
both ships indiscriminately.</p>

<p>During this time the British ships were coming into action
one after another, but very slowly, as the wind, light all the
morning, had now fallen to a mere air, barely sufficient to
bring all our vessels up; thus the first ships engaged had
dreadful odds against them, and the loss of life in them was
great.</p>

<p>After bringing the <i>Redoutable</i> to close action as before
described, Lord Nelson and Captain Hardy, side by side,
calmly walked the centre of the quarter deck, from the poop
to the hatchway. At about 1.25, in their walk forward his
Lordship turned a little short of the hatchway, Captain
Hardy took the other step, and turned also, and beheld
the Admiral in the act of falling. He had been wounded
by a musket ball fired from the mizen-top of the <i>Redoutable</i>,
which struck him in the left shoulder as he turned, and
thence descending, lodged in the spine. He sank on to the
very spot that was still red with his secretary&rsquo;s blood, and
was raised by Sergeant Secker, of the Marines, and two
seamen, who under Captain Hardy&rsquo;s directions, bore him to
the cockpit. &ldquo;They have done for me at last, Hardy,&rdquo;
said the hero as he fell. &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Hardy.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;they have shot my backbone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
through.&rdquo; But his presence of mind was still strong, and he gave
directions for the tautening of the tiller ropes as he
was carried below, and covered his face and decorations
with a handkerchief, that he might not be recognised.</p>

<p>The cockpit was crowded with wounded, and with
difficulty he was borne to a place on the port side, at the
foremost end of it, and placed on a purser&rsquo;s bed with his
back resting against one of the wooden knees of the ship.
Here the surgeon examined his wound, and at once pronounced
it mortal.</p>

<p>In the meantime the battle raged furiously, the men
stationed in the <i>Redoutable&rsquo;s</i> tops (Nelson would allow none
in the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; for fear of setting fire to the sails), had
nearly cleared the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory&rsquo;s</span>&rdquo; upper deck, 40 men being
killed or wounded on the deck alone. The French, seeing
this, attempted to board, but were driven back with great
gallantry by the few men that remained, headed by Captain
Adair, of the Marines.</p>

<p>At about 1.50 the <i>Redoutable</i> ceased firing, and two midshipmen
and a few men were sent from the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; to
assist in putting out a fire that had burst out on board of
her, and the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; then proceeded to get herself clear,
leaving her prize lashed to the <i>Temeraire</i>, that had just
fouled her on the other side. The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was by this
time so crippled in her spars and sails that all efforts on her
part to get into <em>close</em> action (Lord Nelson&rsquo;s favourite position),
with another enemy were ineffectual; but she still
continued engaged on the port side with the <i>Santissima
Trinidada</i> and other ships; and later, with a fresh batch of
the enemy&rsquo;s ships that passed along the line and eventually
escaped.</p>

<p>By 4.30 p.m. the action was over, and a victory was
reported to Lord Nelson just before his death. We left him
in the cockpit, where he was attended by Dr. Scott, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
chaplain, and Mr. Burke, the purser. He had sent the
doctor away to attend to the other wounded, and lay in great
agony, fanned with paper by those two officers, and giving
his last directions as to those he loved; but ever and anon
interrupted by the cheers of the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory&rsquo;s</span>&rdquo; crew, he would
ask the cause, and being told it was a fresh enemy&rsquo;s ship
that had struck her flag, his eye would flash as he expressed
his satisfaction. He frequently asked for Captain Hardy,
and that officer not being able to leave the deck, his anxiety
for his safety became excessive, and he repeated, &ldquo;he must
be killed;&rdquo; &ldquo;he is surely destroyed.&rdquo; An hour had elapsed
before Hardy was able to come to him, when they shook
hands, and the Admiral asked&mdash;&ldquo;How goes the day with
us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, my Lord,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;we have
about 12 of the enemy in our possession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a few minutes of conversation, Hardy had again to
return on deck, and shortly after the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory&rsquo;s</span>&rdquo; port guns
redoubled their fire on some fresh ships coming down on her,
and the concussion so affected Lord Nelson that he cried in
agony, &ldquo;Oh! &lsquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory!</span>&rsquo; &lsquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory!</span>&rsquo; how you distract my
poor brain;&rdquo; but, weak and in pain as he was, he indignantly
rebuked a man, who in passing through the crowded cockpit
struck against and hurt one of the wounded.</p>

<p>Captain Hardy again visited him in about another hour,
and, holding his Lordship&rsquo;s hand, congratulated him on a
brilliant victory, saying, he was certain that 14 ships had
surrendered. &ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I bargained
for 20.&rdquo; Then, Hardy having again to go on deck, Nelson
after emphatically telling him to anchor, and declaring his
intention to direct the fleet as long as life remained, said,
&ldquo;kiss me Hardy,&rdquo; the Captain knelt down and kissed him,
when he said, &ldquo;Now I am satisfied. Thank God I have
done my duty.&rdquo; Twenty minutes later he quietly passed
away, having again and again repeated to his last breath,
the words above mentioned. They were, it has been well
remarked, the whole history of his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
On the firing ceasing, the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; had lost 57 killed
and 103 wounded, and found herself all but a wreck. The
tremendous fire to which she was exposed, when leading her
line into action, had caused great damage, at a very
early period of the battle, and before she herself fired a gun,
many of her spars were shot away, and great injury was done
to the hull, especially the fore part of it.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the action, she had lost her mizen-mast,
the fore-topmast had to be struck to save the foremast;
the mainmast was not much better, and it took all the exertions
of her crew to refit the rigging sufficiently to stand the
bad weather that followed.</p>

<p>The actual number of prizes taken by 5 p.m., on October
21st, were 19; so that Nelson&rsquo;s desired number was nearly
made up; but from their disabled condition, they were
nearly all wrested from us by the gales that succeeded the
battle. Lord Nelson had doubtless foreseen this, and thence
his wish to anchor, and as a matter of fact, most of those
few ships and prizes that did anchor, rode the gale out in
safety and were saved; but the majority of the vessels were
either anchorless, or in such deep water that they could not
with convenience anchor.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory&rsquo;s</span>&rdquo; trophy, the <i>Redoutable</i>, was one of those
that sunk after the action in deep water, and in her, as in
many of the other vessels lost, went down her prize crew of
British seamen. The English fleet were in nearly as disabled
a state as their prizes, as might be expected after such a
battle, and it is a matter of wonder that some of them were
not lost on the treacherous shoal that swallowed up so many
of the captured ships.</p>

<p>The enemy&rsquo;s fleet of 33 sail was disposed of as follows:</p>

<p>On the 22nd, the day after the battle, the breeze was
fresh from the S.S.W., and it was all the ships could do to
increase their distance from the shore, such as were manageable
towing those that were totally dismasted. On the 23rd
it blew a gale, and then the misfortunes of the victors commenced;
the hawsers of many of the ships towing parted,
and the English vessels had too much to do to save themselves
and one another, to attempt to get hold of the prizes
again, so they drifted helplessly away, two to be blown safe
into Cadiz, but seven to meet an awful end amongst the
breakers of that shallow coast. Five others were burnt
and sunk to ensure their not falling into the enemy&rsquo;s hands
again.</p>

<p>On the morning of this day, the remnant of the enemy&rsquo;s
ships put to sea to attempt to recapture some of their friends,
but the gale coming on, the only result was the loss of two
more of themselves, one of which fell into our hands before
going ashore. The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; with the small amount of
sail she could show to the gale, laboured deeply in the heavy
sea, and on the 24th, when the wind moderated a little, she
was taken in tow by the <i>Polyphemus</i>. In the afternoon,
managing to rig up some jury topmasts and a mizen-mast,
she was more comfortable, but at 5 p.m. next day, on the
storm increasing, the towing hawser parted, the mainyard
carried away, and her sails split to ribbons. With nothing
now to steady her, the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; rolled dangerously and
unmanageably, and an anxious night was passed, but happily
for her as well as other of our ships, the violence of the wind
abated in the morning, and the <i>Neptune</i> taking her in tow,
after two days brought her safely into Gibraltar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
In the meantime Lord Nelson&rsquo;s remains had been placed
in a cask of brandy, as the best means at hand of preserving
them, and on the 3rd of November, having refitted, the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; accompanied by the <i>Belleisle</i>, sailed on the
melancholy duty of conveying the body of her hero to
England, and, after a most boisterous passage, reached
Spithead, on December 4th.</p>

<p>Here she was the object of a most intense and reverential
attention, her battered sides, with, in many places, the shot
yet sticking in them; her still bloody decks; her jury masts
and knotted rigging;&mdash;all attested the severity of the ordeal
she had gone through; while the flag that still waved, but at
half-mast, reminded the spectator that the great Admiral who
had such a short time before sailed from that very anchorage
to victory, had now, also, returned to his grave. Amongst
other injuries, the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory&rsquo;s</span>&rdquo; figure-head, a coat of arms
supported by a sailor on one side and a marine on the other,
was struck by shot, which carried away the legs of the
soldier and the arm of the sailor, and the story goes (but we
cannot vouch for its truth), that all the men who lost legs in
the action were marines, and those who lost arms sailors.
The figure-head is still the same, but the wounded supporters
have been replaced by two little boys, who, leaning affectionately
on the shield, seem certainly more fitted for the peaceful
life of Portsmouth Harbour than for the hard times their
more warlike predecessors lived in.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; left Spithead on December 11th for
Sheerness, which was reached on the 22nd, when the hero&rsquo;s
remains, having been deposited in the coffin made from the
mainmast of the <i>L&rsquo;Orient</i> (the French flagship at the Nile),
were transferred to Commissioner Grey&rsquo;s yacht for conveyance
to Greenwich, and thence to St. Paul&rsquo;s. As this was
done, Lord Nelson&rsquo;s flag, which had flown half-mast ever
since the action, was lowered for the last time. The
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; then went to Chatham, paid off on the 16th of
January, 1806, and underwent another thorough repair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
It was agreed on all sides that the enemy fought harder
and more desperately at Trafalgar than they had ever done
before, and at the same time it was undeniable that the
victory was the most complete ever gained. The exultation
that arose in the breasts of all who heard how the pride of
the enemy had been humbled, was embittered by the thought
that their hero and idol was dead; that he, whose very name
ensured victory, would never again lead his ships to the
thickest of the fight, and men doubted whether even the
triumph of Trafalgar was not too dearly bought. But
Nelson had done his work. Never after did the enemy
show a large fleet at sea; and he himself fell, as he had often
wished, in the moment of victory; leaving behind him an
undying fame, and such an example of entire devotion to
his country&rsquo;s service as had never before been equalled in
the world&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>Mr. Devis, the painter of the picture of the &ldquo;Death of
Nelson,&rdquo; now on board the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; went round in her
from Spithead to Sheerness. On the voyage he took
portraits of all the characters depicted, and sketched the
locality, so that this picture may be considered as a truly
historical and faithful one.</p>

<p>In the commencement of 1808, our ally, Sweden, being
threatened by an invasion by Russia, a fleet was sent to the
Baltic to assist them, of which Sir James Saumarez was
appointed Commander-in-Chief, and the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was
once more called into active service as his flagship. She
was commissioned on 18th March, by Captain Dumaresq,
and sailed for the Baltic shortly after, arriving at Gottenburg
at the end of April. To this place the fleet was followed by
a force of 10,000 men under Sir John Moore, who, however,
in consequence of disagreements, were withdrawn in June
and returned to England, leaving Sir James with the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; and ten 74-gun ships, to protect Sweden against
Russians, Danes, French, and Prussians. In August, the
advanced division of the Anglo-Swedish fleet met the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
Russians, and chasing them into Rogerwick, destroyed one
74 and blockaded the remainder in that port. Sir James,
who was on his way north, received this intelligence a few
days afterwards, and hastened to join.</p>

<p>On arriving on August 30th, off Rogerwick, he found the
enemy safe inside, and at once made preparations for an
attack. On the 1st September, in company with the <i>Goliath</i>,
the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; stood in to reconnoitre, and having silenced
a battery that engaged them, a good view of the enemy&rsquo;s
position was obtained, and the next day fixed for the assault.
Unfortunately, the next day broke with a gale of wind, the
ships were unable to move, and the storm lasting eight days,
gave the enemy time to bring troops from Revel, and to
erect batteries on all sides, making any attempt at attack
hopeless. Sir James therefore, after watching the port till
September 30th, sailed for Carlscrona, where he remained till
winter warned him to depart for England. He arrived in the
Downs on 9th December, and at once struck his flag.</p>

<p>The operations in the Baltic in this, and the other four
years in which the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was flagship of Sir James
Saumarez, were, as far as she herself was concerned, mainly
confined to political schemes and transactions; the active
work, such as it was, being done by the frigates and gun-boats,
many of which latter, however, were manned by the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory&rsquo;s</span>&rdquo; officers and men; the Russian fleet never
came out again, but remained shut up in Cronstadt, which
was much too strong to be attacked; thus the proceedings
are of very little interest, and beyond the fact of her being
employed, we have little to record.</p>

<p>She went out almost immediately after the striking of
Saumarez&rsquo;s flag in 1808, as a private ship in the squadron
which was dispatched to Corunna to bring home the army of
the unfortunate Sir John Moore, and returned to Portsmouth
on January 23rd. During this cruise she was commanded
by Captain Searle, but on her going round to Chatham for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
a refit, Captain Dumaresq again returned to her, and Sir
James Saumarez re-hoisting his flag on April 8th, 1809, she
once more sailed for the Baltic, on the navigation being
reported open. The best part of this year was spent by the
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; and fleet of 10 sail, in blockading the Russian
ships in Cronstadt. One successful boat attack was made,
when 8 of the enemy&rsquo;s gun-boats were destroyed, but otherwise
there was no fighting. In the autumn, Sweden was
forced to make peace with Russia, on terms dictated by the
latter, that would have doubtless been harder, had not the
presence of the British fleet prevented any active employment
of the Russian ships. The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; returned to the
Downs by Christmas, and the Admiral struck his flag.</p>

<p>On the 11th March, 1810, Saumarez resumed his command,
and proceeded to Hawke Roads, in Sweden, and
thence to Hano Bay, near Carlscrona, where he laid most
of the year, having a ship or two watching the Russians;
but as they never ventured out, nothing was done, and
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; sailed on 10th October, with 1000 sail of
merchantmen under her convoy. These were seen safely
through the Belt, and Sir James then remained with all his
ships at Hawke Bay, as late as the ice permitted him, to
prevent the possibility of the Russian fleet from the White
Sea entering the Baltic. The Swedes about this time were
compelled by Napoleon to declare war with England, but
the feelings between the two countries were privately as
friendly as before. Hearing that the Archangel ships were
laid up, Saumarez sailed for England, and arriving on 3rd
December, hauled down his flag.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; then again made a trip to the coast of
Portugal, this time with the flag of Rear-Admiral Sir Joseph
S. Yorke, who took a squadron of 7 line-of-battle ships to
Lisbon, with a reinforcement of 6500 men for Sir Arthur
Wellesley, then blockaded in his intrenchments at Torres
Vedras by Massena; but she returned to the Nore in time
to hoist Sir James Saumarez&rsquo;s flag for the fourth year, on the
2nd April, 1811.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
He proceeded to Wingo Sound, and there remained
nearly the whole year. The anomalous state of affairs
between Sweden and ourselves continued, and as public
enemies and private friends we remained until the end of
the year, when Sweden concluded an alliance with England.
The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory&rsquo;s</span>&rdquo; boats made various expeditions against
the Danes, and captured several gun-boats.</p>

<p>On December 18th, the fleet left Wingo for England;
and on the 23rd a gale arose, by which they were dispersed,
and H.M.S. <i>St. George</i> and <i>Defence</i> were wrecked on the
western coast of Jutland, and the <i>Hero</i> off the Texel; but
the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; and other ships weathered it in safety, and
anchored at St. Helen&rsquo;s on Christmas Day, when Sir James
struck his flag.</p>

<p>On April 14th, 1812, it was again hoisted, and on the
28th, &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; sailed with a squadron of 10 sail of the
line, and took her station as usual at Wingo. The naval
operations this year were more active than before; the Danes
had equipped a good many frigates and small craft for
attacks on the Swedish coast, and frequent engagements took
place between them and our smaller vessels; but &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo;
was not herself in action. In October, orders were received
from England to send his flagship home, and on the 15th of
that month, Sir James shifted his flag to the <i>Pyramus</i>, and
&ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; sailed for England, and arriving at Portsmouth,
was paid off in November.</p>

<p>This was the last active service of this glorious old ship,
though she was on the point of being sent to sea again in
1815, when no less than six Admirals, on applying for commands,
named the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; as the ship they would wish
to have, although there were many new ships, larger, and
carrying much heavier ordnance; but the prestige attached
to the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; besides her well known sailing qualities,
outweighed every other consideration. Waterloo, however,
soon put an end to that war, and the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; was never
re-commissioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
In 1825 she was made flagship in Portsmouth harbour,
and ever since that date, with but few intervals, she has
continued to bear the flags of Admirals, who, having like
her, spent their lives in the service of their country, terminate
their active careers by holding the highest post in the
British Navy,&mdash;the command at Portsmouth. Every year,
as the 21st October, the anniversary of Trafalgar, comes
round, daylight discovers the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; with a wreath of
laurel at each mast-head, a continual memorial of the deeds
of that ever-to-be-remembered day, when at one blow the
naval power of two great nations was crippled, and the
superiority of England established without dispute.</p>

<p>In 1844, Queen Victoria happened to be passing through
the harbour on this day, and learning the cause of the
decoration of the &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>,&rdquo; at once pulled on board,
and went round the ship. Her Majesty evinced much
emotion, when shown the almost sacred spots where the
hero fell and died; and plucking some leaves from the
wreath that enshrined the words on the poop, &ldquo;England
expects that every man will do his duty,&rdquo; kept them as a
memento.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;<span class="smlcap">Victory</span>&rdquo; now no longer bears the Admiral&rsquo;s
flag; the increasing numbers of seamen in our dep&ocirc;ts,
rendered in 1869 a larger ship more convenient, and she is
retained in her position in the harbour solely as a reminiscence
of the past; and it almost seems a pity that she
cannot be now fitted up internally, as nearly as possible as
she was at Trafalgar, that the thousands of annual visitors
might form a better idea of the state of the decks of a man-of-war
of the olden time when going into action; and that
in these days of rapid and enormous changes in both shipbuilding
and ordnance, a type of the man-of-war that won
England her pre-eminence, might be preserved to all time.</p>
